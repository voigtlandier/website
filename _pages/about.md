I am a research scientist, technical lead, and engineering manager at <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> in Seattle where I lead a team working on the future of communication. Prior to joining Google, I was associate professor of computer science at the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a>. I hold a PhD in computer science from <a href="http://www.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a> and a BS in electrical engineering from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.

My research spans computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. I have worked on a wide range of problems in physically-based rendering, real-time rendering, material appearance modeling and representation, computational fabrication, and acquisition of 3D geometry and material properties. My recent work has focused on high-fidelity real-time 3D capture, 3D display technologies, and digital relighting.
