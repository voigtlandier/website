I am a research scientist at <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> in Seattle. I co-founded and currently lead the research and engineering team behind <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline" target="_blank">Project Starline</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/Q13CishCKXY" target="_blank">video</a>). Prior to joining Google, I was associate professor of computer science at the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a>. I hold a PhD in computer science from <a href="http://www.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Princeton University</a> and a BS in electrical engineering from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.

My research interests span computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. I have worked on a wide range of topics including physically-based rendering, real-time rendering, material appearance modeling and representation, computational fabrication, and systems for acquiring dense accurate measurements of 3D geometry and material appearance. My recent work has focused on high-fidelity real-time 3D capture, 3D display technologies, digital relighting, and real-time communications.
